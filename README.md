This is my streaming app. You can create an account to make playlists or sign in as a guest (but you won't be able to create playlists).
When you first sign in you will be taken to the homepage that has 8 cartoons on it you can select any of those 8 cartoond and be taken to the first episode from that cartoon. Or you can select the "Cartoons List ->" button on the top right and see a whole list of cartoons from A-Z.
When you are on the cartoons page the video player is the first thing you see if you scroll down, You will see a "add to playlist" where you can add that video to a selected playlist or create a new one.
